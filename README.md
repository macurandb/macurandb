# Hello, I'm Duany Bar√≥ Men√©ndez! üëã

As an AI Software Engineering Consultant with 10+ years of experience, I partner with companies to design, build, and scale intelligent, high-performance systems.

My core strength lies in leveraging Python, Go, and Rust, underpinned by deep software architecture expertise and hands-on execution, to turn complex AI concepts into robust, production-ready solutions that create real business value.

I specialize in translating ambitious business requirements into cutting-edge, cloud-native applications‚Äîparticularly where AI/ML meets real-world constraints. This includes building AI-powered features, optimizing MLOps pipelines, and architecting distributed systems for real-time data processing.

Whether the solution requires custom development or fast automation using low-code tools like n8n or Make, my focus remains on delivering scalable, maintainable, and results-oriented systems. I adapt the technology stack to the business need, not the other way around.

I apply a ‚Äúbest-tool-for-the-job‚Äù approach:

- Python for its rich AI/ML ecosystem
- Go for concurrency, speed, and service reliability
- Rust for performance-critical and safety-sensitive components
